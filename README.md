# IoTBlockchain
App for a WiFi router that currently uses Merkle trees to verify that data is being sent from point A to B securely, before sending it off to Wink. Wrote a...spartan...Wink API in C. The plan is to expand this into a blockchain over a widely distributed system, so Wink could have possible backups of data in case of crashes, as well as the ability for IoT to IoT direct transactions over time.

To be compiled with OpenWRT
